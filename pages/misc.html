        <h2>We've shared so many moments together...</h2>
        <p>And while I've mostly just gone over gaming memories, there's plenty others too. Learning to program websites like these together is another, our struggles we've had with others and how we lean on each other... Our dreams and plans to make our lives together... It's all important. Every little thing. From the silly ideas of what we want from our home servers and labs, to the cozy thoughts of going on walks together and watching anime in each others arms. And that's just it, we've also been watching things together too! TADC, JJK, Jobless Reincarnation... Soon to be Made in Abyss too!</p> 
        
        <p>There's a lot of things we can share together, and even this list is so far from complete. Every little detail lives in my head on repeat bringing me hope when I'm at my lowest. Every little thing we share is the reason why I keep on pushing forward. With you, I feel more capable. I push myself to learn new things, create new things. I take a step out of my shell and I feel just a little bit stronger now that you're in my life. I'll tie this up before these paragraphs get *too* lengthy to fit nicely on the page...</p>

        <p>Thank you for being with me, through everything!</p>
