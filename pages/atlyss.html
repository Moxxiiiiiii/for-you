        <h2>A journey through struggles.</h2>
        <p>Atlyss to me was a turning point in our relationship, I had been getting closer to you mostly as a friend until then. I was still... With Mes and all the struggles that entailed. Life was really hard for me back then, coming off of a series of abuse and failed relationships that left me spiralling trying to find something to hold onto. You came into my life and as we got along, you supported me and worked with me through so many things. This game, this silly little cozy thing was a nice way to really just enjoy being with you. Have a cute little character, and step away from the mess of my life. I played it solo first, but I barely remember it. Yet I can remember all the little breakdowns you helped me through, the smiles we had... The emote spam once we figured out how to do that... Those things stick with me more than the mechanics of the game. And the bugs too! Like everything being invisible in the last dungeon!!!!</p>
