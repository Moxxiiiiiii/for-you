        <h2>And it's not hard to see why.</h2>
        <p>I never expected for you to get so deep into this series... Or really even enjoy playing it with me since to start with you weren't really all that interested. Still, you humoured me in joining along for the ride and to this day I'm so glad you did!! From the introduction into rise, the diving deeper into wilds and world... And everything that came after... It's been a blessing to share these memories with you and we're far from done yet! We still need to finish world, do some wilds stuff together and then head on over to GenU! So much to explore and I want to do it all with you... Thank you for sharing these memories with me darling~!!!</p>
